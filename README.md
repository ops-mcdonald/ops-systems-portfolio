# Operations Systems Portfolio

This repository demonstrates **tool-agnostic operational systems** designed for:

- Task prioritization
- Risk prediction
- Administrative workflow governance
- Error detection & adaptation

The goal is to provide **documentation-first systems** that are reproducible and adaptable across tools and organizations.

## Structure

- `diagrams/` — Flowcharts and diagrams of workflows and system processes
- `templates/` — SOPs, task templates, incident templates
- `systems_theory/` — Experimental notes on relevant systems theories
- `experimental/` — Sandbox for predictive models, priority formulas, and workflow experiments

## Key Principles

1. **Documentation-First**: Systems must be human-readable.
2. **Error-Aware**: Every task, incident, and system has a feedback loop.
3. **Tool-Agnostic**: Logic is transferable to Notion, MS365, or other platforms.
4. **Predictive**: Systems integrate simple risk evaluation and prioritization.
5. **Portfolio-Proof**: Each file demonstrates capability for freelance or client work.
